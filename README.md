This is a wrapper for adb to execute "scripted" commands to FireTV.<br />
<br />
For a while I was maintining scripts in both Powershell and Linux Bash to execute adb commands on my FireTVs and Fire Sticks. I got sick of maintaining the same script in two different languages, of which I'm not particularly fond of. Both are arguably powerful in their own rights, but the syntax is ugly and very different, especially Linux Bash. I decided to write the scripts into an Odin program so that there is only one language and place to maintain updates. This also serves as a place to store adb commands I've learned and found useful. Additionally, some of the less than trivial commands perform some useful parsing of the data, hence the "scripting" part.<br />

| -nc         | -nocolor     | none                   | Disables colored output. Removes ANSI color codes to make scripting easier. Color is automatically disabled if it is disabled in the terminal. |

| -wake       |              | none                   | Attempts to wake the device. Only works if device is not asleep for long.
| -sleep      |              | none                   | Attempts to put the device into sleep mode. Recommend using this as the last command if using mulitples.
| -d          | -dumpsys     | see description        | Gets information from the device database. A typical argument may be 'power' or 'activity'. Place any argument that has spaces in quotes. Use '--help' as an argument to get dumpsys help.
| -k          | -kill        | all or package name    | Stops the specified package name. If 'all' is provided, all (3rd Party) user packages are stopped.
| -l          | -launch      | package name           | Starts the specified package name or brings it to the front if already running. Kodi supported. Others may or may not be depending if they require a unique 'Starting Intent'. Support may be added upon request.
| -m          | -memoryusage | package name           | Outputs current memory usage of specified package name.
| -p          | -packages    | user or system         | Lists (3rd Party) 'user' installed packages or (FireOS) 'system' installed packages.
| -s          | -space       | system or package name | Outputs disk space usage for either 'system' or specified package name.
| -clearcache |              | package name           | Clears cache for the specified package name. Take cear with what packages you clear. Some apps may revert to new install configuration like Kodi does.

<b>Example Usage</b><br />
kill all running user installed (3rd Party) packages, start Kodi, and get space usage of Kodi<br />
adbfiretv -c IPAddress -k all -l org.xbmc.kodi -s org.xbmc.kodi<br />
<br />
<b>Install Odin See:</b><br />
https://odin-lang.org/docs/<br />
<br />
<b>Compile with Odin:</b><br />
1. In the terminal, navigate to the folder where this code is located.<br />
2. odin build .<br />
<br />
ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and Developer Options enabled in the FireOS is required.<br />
<br />
<b>Install adb in Ubuntu:</b><br />
sudo apt install adb<br />
<br />
<b>Install adb in Windows:</b><br />
winget install Google.PlatformTools<br />
<br />
<b>Enable Developer Options in FireOS:</b><br />
1. Go to "Settings", "Device & Software", "About".<br />
2. Press "Your TV" seven times to unlock "Developer Options".<br />
3. Back up to "Device & Software", "Developer Options" should now show in the menu.<br />
4. Go to "Developer Options" and enable "ADB Debugging".<br />
5. When you connect for the first time to FireoS, ADB will fail, but an authorization window will popup on the TV.<br />
6. Check the box to allow the connection ID generated by ADB.<br />
7. After this, all future connections will be allowed from that specific computer<br />
